## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please check the [existing issues](https://github.com/OpenQudit/openqudit/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported.

If you're opening a new issue, please include:

1.  A clear, descriptive title.
2.  A detailed description of the problem.
3.  Steps to reproduce the bug.
4.  The version of Rust used, operating system, and if using Python, the Python version.
5.  A **minimal reproducible example**, if possible. This is the most helpful thing you can do!

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement:

1.  Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/OpenQudit/openqudit/issues) to see if your idea has already been discussed.
2.  Open a new issue, clearly describing the feature you'd like to see, why it's needed/wanted, and any other valuable information regarding design or implementation.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues tagged `good first issue`. These are great starting points.

## Development Setup

We use a Rust workspace to manage multiple crates.

1. **Install** necessary dependencies. LLVM development libraries will need to be accessible to build OpenQudit.
2. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
3. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/openqudit.git
   cd openqudit
   ```
4. **Build** the project to make sure everything is working:
   ```bash
   cargo build --workspace
   ```
5. **Run Tests** to confirm your local setup is correct:
   ```bash
   cargo test --workspace
   ```

### Python Development Setup

OpenQudit uses [Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) to build the python library from the qudit-python crate. This sets the `python` feature flag on all of the other rust crates. If you would like to do python-driven development, after ensuring you have installed `uv` and you have forked and cloned the repo:

Setup (in [crates/qudit-python](./crates/qudit-python)) a virtual environment:

```bash
uv sync --group=dev
```

This may take a second to build the package the first time.

#### Python Tests

To run Python tests, in the [qudit-python](./crates/qudit-python) crate, run:

```bash
uv run pytest tests
```

#### Python Stubs

Python stubs will automatically be built by pre-commit (see the [next section](#pre-commit-hooks-recommended)).

If you'd like to build the stubs manually to test Python additions, you can run `cargo run --bin stub_gen` in [./crates/qudit-python](./crates/qudit-python), and it will automatically generate new stubs in the [openqudit](./crates/qudit-python/openqudit) folder.

Stubs are built from the associated Rust/pyo3 implementation and doc comments.

### Pre-commit Hooks (recommended)

This repo ships a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` that runs the checks from the [Pull Request Process](#pull-request-process) below automatically:

**Note**: You will need `uv` installed (see [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) to run all the pre-commit hooks, as one of them runs Python tests.

1.  **Install** [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and [cargo-deny](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny):

```bash
pip install pre-commit
cargo install cargo-deny
```

2.  **Set up the hooks** from the repo root:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

This installs two git hooks:

- **pre-commit** (every commit): runs `cargo fmt`, reformatting files in place. If it changes anything, the commit is aborted so you can review and re-stage.
- **pre-push** (every push): runs `cargo deny`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`, `cargo doc`, `pytest`, and `cargo run --bin stub_gen`.

You can also run all the push-stage checks manually at any time with `pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage pre-push`.

## Updating Third-Party Licenses

Updating the `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.json` file requires [cargo-bundle-licenses](https://github.com/sstadick/cargo-bundle-licenses) to be installed.

1. In the qudit-python crate, regenerate to a temporary JSON file:

```bash
cargo bundle-licenses --format json --previous THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.json --output tmp.json
```

2. Format the JSON to remove duplicate licenses if an MIT license is already present:

```bash
jq '.third_party_libraries |= map(
  if (.licenses | any(.license == "MIT")) then
    .license = "MIT" |
    .licenses |= map(select(.license == "MIT"))
  else
    .
  end
)' tmp.json > THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.json
```

3. Remove `tmp.json`

4. Review the output for any licenses listed as `"NOT FOUND"`.

If there are any, find the license online, copy the file contents, format (for example on macOS: `pbpaste | jq -Rs | pbcopy`), and replace `"NOT FOUND"`.

## Pull Request Process

> [!TIP]
> Almost all of these steps can be run automatically or in one command with [pre-commit](#pre-commit-hooks-recommended)

When you're ready to submit your contribution:

1.  Create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

2.  Make your changes and commit them with a clear message.
3.  **Format your code:**

```bash
cargo fmt
```

4.  **Check licenses and advisories:**

````bash
cargo deny --config ./.cargo/deny.toml --all-features check

5.  **Check for lint warnings:**

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --features python --all-targets -- -D warnings
````

6.  **Check for doc warnings:**

```bash
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps
```

7.  **Run Rust tests:**

```bash
cargo test --workspace --features python
```

8.  **Generate Python stubs:**

```bash
cd crates/qudit-python
cargo run --bin stub_gen
```

9.  **Run Python tests:**

```bash
# In crates/qudit-python
uv run pytest tests/
```

10. **Push** your branch to your fork on GitHub:

```bash
# Back in project root
git add .
git commit -m "added my feature"
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

11. **Open a Pull Request** (PR) on the main repository.

12. In your PR description:

- Clearly describe the problem and your solution.
- If your PR fixes an existing issue, link it (e.g., "Fixes #123").
- Ensure all CI checks (GitHub Actions) are passing.

A maintainer will review your PR, provide feedback, and merge it when it's ready.
